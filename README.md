SDLplayer
=========

(old) androVM player based on libSDL

cmake was originally used for all platforms but is finally only used for Mac OS ...
For Windows and Linux use specific Makefile.* files

If anybody wants to update the CMakeFiles.txt to have again all 3 platforms support in it, dont hesitate :-)
